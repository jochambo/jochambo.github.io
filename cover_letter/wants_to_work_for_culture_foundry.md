      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about me</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I am a web developer.</span> I make web apps that solve real problems in ways that are beautiful and intuitive. I get excited about using the best tool for the job. Sometimes that means trying a few times. It's more important to recognize clean code than to just make it work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I am not just a web developer.</span> I spent ten years in Naval Aviation, learned how to fly, to teach, and to learn. I've played guitar in more countries than I can count, but only for myself and my wife.  Every so often I cook a mean meal for my family and friends.  And there was this one time down in Honduras that my rear truck wheel passed me on the highway.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I just graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</span> I started programming primarily during military deployments before Dev Bootcamp, but I learned more in the past nineteen weeks than I've ever learned in any other nineteen-week chunk of my life. At Dev Bootcamp, I learned how to learn new things really quickly, and to work with a team not just to get the job done, but to do it creatively. The last few years have proved how much programmers really enjoy sharing the work that we do.  We love to talk about our latest projects or argue about the latest solutions to nagging problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I learned to love Javascript and Ruby.</span> I was excited, actually excited to learn React for the front-end of our final project. There were a lot of options, but I took the leap with my team into learning a new framework (version 0.11!) knowing we would have a little time to switch to another framework if necessary. React turned out to be a good gamble. The result was computationally quick and the UX remained very simple.  After that experience, I have no fear of trying something new insofar as I can find the best tool for the job.

      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about you</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You care about your craft.</span> And you care about growing junior developers into craftsmen. By advertising listings for junior devs you are making a concerted effort to expand the development community.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You develop community around software.</span> After years in the military, sometimes with very small, I dare say even agile, groups, I recognize the power of real teamwork. You work hard to foster not just a common mission, but the idea that not only is everyone, including the customer, involved in the mission, but that it is impossible to achieve alone. And the fact that you equate this to family is fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You are making the web a better place.</span> I love the web. It saddens me that so much of the space is reserved for what Dan Melnick calls "micro-optimizing super-comfortable lives". Looking through your portfolio of projects, it seems you are doing the hard work to make the lives of those attempting to bring better healthcare, better education, and many other areas easier. As the son of a nurse and a paramedic, I can appreciate anyone who helps these unsung heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You don't take yourselves too seriously.</span> You are serious about your craft, but you understand that a sustainable work pace is more productive than burning people out. That's why you choose to place your offices in some of the coolest places this country has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blue">I'm your guy.</span> Shoot me an <a href="mailto:joey.chamberlin@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (757-343-8027). I can be in any of your offices in less than 24 hours, if the wind is behind me.
