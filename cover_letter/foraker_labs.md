      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about me</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I am a web developer.</span> I make web apps that are useful, beautiful, and intuitive. I get excited about using the best tool for the job, and believe good design runs through the whole app. Clear, descriptive variable names are just as important as choosing the right font.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I am not just a web developer.</span> I spent ten years in Naval Aviation, learned how to fly, to teach, and to learn. I've played guitar in more countries than I can count, but only for myself and my wife.  And there was this one time down in Honduras that my rear truck wheel passed me on the highway.

        <span class="peach">I just graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</span> I started programming during military deployments before Dev Bootcamp, but I learned more in the past nine weeks than I've ever learned in any other nine-week chunk of my life. At Dev Bootcamp, I learned how to learn new things really quickly, and to take pride in writing elegant, clear, tested code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I learned to love Javascript and Ruby.</span> I was excited, actually excited to learn React for the front-end of our final project. There were a lot of options, but I took the leap with my team into learning a new framework (version 0.11!) knowing we would have a little time to switch to another framework if necessary. React turned out to be a good gamble. The result was computationally quick and the UX remained very simple.  After that experience, I have no fear of trying something new insofar as I can find the best tool for the job.

      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about you</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You care about your craft.</span> I've been reading your blog posts on organizational patterns in Backbone.js, and I appreciated the way you started with a functional (but poorly organized) solution, then stepped up through increasingly modular design patterns. You care about building things the right way, not just making them work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You develop people.</span> Your blog posts make it clear that lifetime learning matters to you. You take the time to give back to the tech community. You employ junior developers. You seem to be making an intentional effort to create a better tech community. I want to be a part of a team that grows together; one in which people drive each other to become better craftsmen and craftswomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You are making the web a better place.</span> I love the web. I am excited about building beautiful and meaningful things for the web. Unfortunately, so much of the products out there are poorly designed and relatively useless. I hate seeing a client get a bad value for their money, just because they worked with a consultancy that cared more about getting paid than about meeting the client's actual needs. And some of your projects, like SchoolVault, OneFreedom and BehaviorSnap, are making the world a better place. So much of the tech industry is built around micro-optimizing already comfortable lives, but I want the opportunity to work on projects that empower people to do real good in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You don't take yourselves too seriously.</span> You are serious about your craft, but you understand that a sustainable work pace is more productive than burning people out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blue">I'm your guy.</span> Shoot me an <a href="mailto:joey.chamberlin@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (757-343-8027). I can be in Boulder in 18 hours, if the wind is behind me.
