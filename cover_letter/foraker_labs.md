      <p class="project-title">let's talk about me</p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="blue">I am a web developer.</span> I make web apps that are useful, beautiful, and intuitive. I get excited about using the best tool for the job, and believe good design runs through the whole app. Clear, descriptive variable names are just as important as choosing the right font.
      </p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="secondary-col">I am not just a web developer.</span> I play 6 instruments, and sometimes still build castles with Legos. I make electric guitars, and have restored a mid-century Gibson banjo that had been left in a garage for far too long. In a past life, I taught 8th grade history, and since then have organized tutoring and mentoring programs in Peoria, IL. I am addicted to Big Ten basketball. I've been known to make a pretty outstanding whiskey sour. I come up with the worst puns.

        <h4 class="project-tag black-scrim">building things is my favorite</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="purple">I just graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</span> I started programming before Dev Bootcamp, but I learned more in the past nine weeks than I've ever learned in any other nine-week chunk of my life. At Dev Bootcamp, I learned how to learn new things really quickly, and to take pride in writing elegant, clear, tested code.
      </p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="orange">I learned to love Javascript and Ruby.</span> I built my final project entirely in Javascript, after building it once in Rails. I was curious about the differences between the two languages, and thought that building the same product in both would be an interesting experiment. The Javascript version, built with Node and Angular, was exponentially faster, smoother, and cheaper (both computationally and in terms of dollars spent to deploy it on Heroku). After that experience, I still certainly have a special place in my heart for Ruby, but Javascript is my soulmate, as it were.

      <p class="project-title">let's talk about you</p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="orange">You care about your craft.</span> I've been reading your blog posts on organizational patterns in Backbone.js, and I appreciated the way you started with a functional (but poorly organized) solution, then stepped up through increasingly modular design patterns. You care about building things the right way, not just making them work.
      </p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="purple">You develop people.</span> Your blog posts make it clear that lifetime learning matters to you. You take the time to give back to the tech community. You employ junior developers. You seem to be making an intentional effort to create a better tech community. I want to be a part of a team that grows together; one in which people drive each other to become better craftsmen and craftswomen.
      </p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="secondary-col">You are making the web a better place.</span> I love the web. I am excited about building beautiful and meaningful things for the web. Unfortunately, so much of the products out there are poorly designed and relatively useless. I hate seeing a client get a bad value for their money, just because they worked with a consultancy that cared more about getting paid than about meeting the client's actual needs. And some of your projects, like SchoolVault, OneFreedom and BehaviorSnap, are making the world a better place. So much of the tech industry is built around micro-optimizing already comfortable lives, but I want the opportunity to work on projects that empower people to do real good in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="blue">You don't take yourselves too seriously.</span> You are serious about your craft, but you understand that a sustainable work pace is more productive than burning people out.
      </p>
      <p class="cover-column">
        <span class="green">I'm your guy.</span> Shoot me an <a href="mailto:zpfled@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (309-573-6404). I can be in Boulder in 18 hours, if the wind is behind me.
