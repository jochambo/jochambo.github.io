      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about me</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I am a web developer.</span> I make web apps that solve real problems in ways that are beautiful and intuitive. I get excited about using the best tool for the job, and believe good design runs through the whole app. And creating this software in an environment that values open source would be a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I just graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</span> I started programming primarily during military deployments.  At DBC, I learned how to break problems down to their smallest parts, and to work with a team not just to get the job done, but to do it creatively. The last few years have proved how much programmers really enjoy sharing the work that we do.  We love to talk about our latest projects or argue about the latest solutions to nagging problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I am not just a web developer.</span> I spent ten years in flying for the Navy, teaching and learning along the way. I've played guitar in more countries than I can count, but only for myself and my wife.  Every so often I cook a mean meal for my family and friends.  And there was this one time down in Honduras that my rear truck wheel passed me on the highway.

        <span class="peach">Learning new technologies is fun.</span> I was excited to use a brand new framework for the front-end of my DBC final project. There were a lot of options, but I took the leap with my team into learning Facebook's React (version 0.11!) knowing we would have a little time to switch to another framework if necessary. React turned out to be a good gamble. The result was computationally quick and the UX remained very simple.  After that experience, I have no fear of trying something new insofar as I can find the best tool for the job.

      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about you</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You care about your clients.</span>Many of those who work at UNAVCO are scientist who understand the rigors of experimentation at the scale you are working at. It means providing rugged and well tested software and hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You develop people.</span> Lifetime learning matters to you. You take the time to give back to the tech community. You seem to be making an intentional effort to create a better tech community. I want to be a part of a team that grows together; one in which people drive each other to become better craftsmen and craftswomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You are making the web a better place.</span> I love the web. I am excited about building beautiful and meaningful things for the web. Unfortunately, so much of what is out there exists only to solve first-world problems.  You seek to use resources efficiently and effectively in order maintain "open access to data, data products, and scientific exchange".
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You are serious about the science.</span> I was first introduced to the science behind geodesy in the Navy while learning about GPS, RADAR and SAR. I was fascinated that so much problem solving had gone into what on the surface seemed a simple problem, "Where am I?".
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blue">I'm your guy.</span> Shoot me an <a href="mailto:joey.chamberlin@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (757-343-8027). I can be in Boulder in 18 hours, if the wind is behind me.
