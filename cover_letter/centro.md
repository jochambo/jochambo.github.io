      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about me</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">I am a web developer.</span> I make web apps that are useful, beautiful, and intuitive. I get excited about using the best tool for the job, and believe good design runs through the whole app. Clear, descriptive variable names are just as important as choosing the right font.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I am not just a web developer.</span> That said... I just graduated from <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>. I started programming primarily during military deployments.  At DBC, I learned how to break problems down to their smallest parts, and to work with a team not just to get the job done, but to do it creatively. I enjoy how much programmers really love sharing the work that we do.  We love to talk about our latest projects or argue about the latest solutions to nagging problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">Learning new technologies is fun.</span> I was excited to use React for the front-end of our final project. There were a lot of options, but I took the leap with my team into learning a new framework (version 0.11!) knowing we would have very little time to switch to another framework if necessary. React turned out to be a good gamble. The result was computationally quick and the UX remained very simple.  After that experience, I have no fear of trying something new insofar as I can find the best tool for the job.

      <p class="letter-title">let's talk about you</p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You develop people.</span> Your manifesto makes it clear that individual improvement improves the whole. I've been part of some atrocious planning teams in the past and seen the effects of a stagnate process of ever-multiplying layers of approvals and stakeholders. I have also been a part of numerous teams in the military that were what I now know as agile. Short iterations, continuous integration and a focus on continuous improvement were hallmarks that you have had a hand in shaping. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You influence the advertising industry with disruptive software.</span> You love to deliver features to customers because of how you build relationships with them.  They are excited to be a part of the feedback loop knowing that you can serve them better with their input. To completely rethink the way that ads are sold the way you have puts you squarely at the forefront.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You are making the web a better place.</span> I love the web. I am excited about building beautiful and meaningful things for it. Unfortunately, so much of the products out there are poorly designed and relatively useless. Your products touch a core need of making people work better, not harder, together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="peach">You don't take yourselves too seriously.</span> You work hard, but you understand that a sustainable work pace is more productive than burning people out. It doesn't hurt that you provide a comfortable work environment. That and the people that you bring together are the reasons you have been named a Best Place to Work for 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blue">I'm your guy.</span> Shoot me an <a href="mailto:joey.chamberlin@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (757-343-8027). I can be in Boulder in 18 hours, if the wind is behind me.
