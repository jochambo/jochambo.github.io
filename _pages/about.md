## About Joey


I'm a craftsman. I get excited about solving interesting problems, but I am even more interested in building something right, rather than just cobbling together something that works.

Until recently, I served in the U.S. Navy as a Flight Officer. I served as an aircraft mission commander around the world. The Navy sent me to Japan to serve as Operations Officer under the Deputy for Theater Anti-submarine Warfare. While there, I experienced the Tohoku Earthquake, and participated in our nation's response to the tragedy.

Colleagues know me as a highly creative and tactically proficient worker who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach. My experiences have given me perspective that any complex problem can be solved by forming motivated, creative individuals into a team.

By taking the leap into programming, I am pursuing what I loved in the Navy, namely, collaborating with others on tough and technical problems. I can (and often do) work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best collaborating with others.  We should talk.
