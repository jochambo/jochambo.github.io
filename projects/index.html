      <p>browsin' provides users with an efficient way to search streaming movies and shows based on their subscriptions. Simplicity of the software and speed were top priorities for our team on this project. We decided to implement React as a front-end and Ruby on Rails.  I was responsible for the search controller implementing multiple search queries across the database. Additionally, I wrote in React and used Javascript, jQuery and Ajax to round it out.</p>

      <a href="http://mano-a-many.herokuapp.com"><h2>Mano-a-many</h2></a>
      <p>Mano-a-Many is a social debt calculator, built as a five-day project for Dev Bootcamp. Users can keep track of what they owe their friends, and how much their friends owe them. For larger groups, users can consolidate all debts down to a few transactions.</p>
      <p>This was a challenging implementation of some complex mathematics. The site needed a simple interface that helped users understand how we arrived at the solution. I wrote most of the front-end including AJAX calls to make the UX as smooth as possible.</p>
