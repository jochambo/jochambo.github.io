      <p>browsin' provides users with an efficient way to search streaming movies and shows based on their subscriptions. Simplicity of the software and speed were top priorities for our team on this project. We decided to implement React as a front-end and Ruby on Rails.</p>
      <p>In my Dev Bootcamp eight-day project, I was responsible for the search controller allowing multiple queries across the database. There were a few days I dreamed at night about Regex, but I'm okay now. Additionally, I wrote in React and used Javascript, jQuery and Ajax to round it out.</p>

      <p>Mano-a-Many helps friends stay friends when they find themselves needing to share a bill at a restaurant or pick up coffee for the office. Users can keep track of what they owe their friends, and how much their friends owe them. For larger groups, users can consolidate everything down to a few transactions.</p>
      <p>We had five-days to complete a challenging implementation of some complex mathematics. The site needed a simple interface that helped users understand how we arrived at the solution. I wrote most of the front-end including AJAX calls to make the UX as smooth as possible.</p>
